            always been my home. Since a young age, I've only ever seen small parts of the outside.
            I've always wanted to see what was beyond the armed guards and
            smooth concrete. Despite the adventurer inside of me, the city offers
            so much that it makes anybody want to stay forever. When the sun
            settles over the horizon and the moon rises, the city comes to life.
            The buzzing neon lights, beautiful street dancers, and the many
            people enjoying themselves can all be seen making the city lively. It's a happy place, but all good things
            must come to an end.</b

            >The Hustle & Bustle. The beeping of cars, screaming market men, and
            the screeching of police sirens. Every now and again you might hear
            gunshots. Where did they come from? Who shot? Wrong questions. Just
            keep your head down and keep pushing. If you don't bring attention
            to yourself, then you become a nobody. Being a nobody is about the
            safest thing you can be. The city's downtown market is where you'll
            find most of the lights and people. Everyone here is always selling
            and buying. Doesn't matter what it is, as long as money is tied to
            it. I like it down here. I only come down here to see Old Man Yuki,
            though. He sells the best fish. He has a premium fishing license,
            allowing him access to the outside. When I was a kid he would
            sometimes sneak me out to see the world. That's where I learned to
            fish, but that's where I also learned to hide. Old Yuki taught me
            everything I know about being hidden. How to hold your breath under
            water for long periods of time, how to fit in small places, and even
            how to walk and run silently. Back then I thought that's how we
            caught fish, I couldn't be more wrong. He was preparing me for the
            cruel reality of our world. "Hey, son! How long has it been?" Yuki
            asked. "Too long! You still up and kicking!?" I laughed. "Oh you
            know me. So, how's business?" "Bien." "Oh boy, you know I don't
            speak that tongue." "Yeah yeah. Still got my favorites, old man?"
            "Oh yes! Only the best for you." He gave me a plate of two fresh
            cooked salmon. "Thanks old man, here's a tip." I offered him some of
            my coin, but he rejected it. "You know I don't need the money," he
            said. "Suit yourself." As I was walking away he called out to me.
            "You know the shop will soon be yours! Keep a good head on your
            shoulders, will ya!?" "Sure thing, Mr. Yuki!" I saw his sweet smile
            before I disappeared behind the crowds of people, eating my favorite
            salmon. Yuki has always been there for me ever since he found me in
            one of his crates. He didn't know who I belonged to, so he took it
            upon himself to raise me while also trying to manage his business.
            Though I love seeing him, he's not why I'm downtown. I had a little
            meet up with one of my friends. I had something for him.</b

              >The alleyways is never somewhere you want to be, especially if
              you don't got any business being there. Too many loose screws
              there. If you so much as look at one of these guys, you're dead.
              For me, however, guys like these aren't a problem. My
              freind told me to meet him in the alley behind Rasputin's. I
              scoped the area just in case it was set up. I dropped from the
              ledge above him and started talking business. "Ah! There you are!
              I've been waiting for hours," he said. His name is Crunch. He's a
              scrawny fellow, but he's also jittery and quick on his feet. "Stop
              complaining. I'm here, aren't I?" I replied. "So, you got it?" He
              asked. "Of course I got it, now where's my payment?" I threw him a
              level three clearence card. "P-Payment? Haha, y-you see-" I threw
              him against the wall. "No funny stuff! Pay up, now!" I yelled. "I
              don't call you Crunch just because," I said, grabbing his arm that
              was in a cast. "H-Hurt me all you want, but let me tell you this.
              I-I have two snipers o-on the roof and f-four men here in this
              alley," he said. I looked around and saw nothing. I raised my
              fist, ready to punch him. "Not making this easy huh, Crunch?" I
              swung, but I stopped. I smelled something. Batteries. Not the kind
              that you would usually smell. It was Eco Batts. "Wraiths!? Are you
              serious Crunch!?" I dropped him and ran.</b

              The only people that use Eco batteries are Wraiths. Wraiths are an
              elite police force armed with cloaking technology that makes them
              invisble. The only way to detect them is by the smell of their
              burning batteries. He sold me out to the feds! Damn it! I knew I
              couldn't trust him! "Get out my way!" I yelled as I ran through
              the city, pushing people out my way. I could smell them chasing
              me. Six chasing me. Two flanking right and two flanking left. Two
              are jumping from rooftop to rooftop trying to get a good shot. I'm
              so thankful for this smell of mine. Hopping fences, hurdling over
              cars, even turning corners is not enough to shake them. I was
              running until my body went cold. BANG! It was one of the snipers.
              They had just barely missed my foot. I heard sirens. It was a cruiser flying in front of me. "Stop where you are
              and put your hands up!" An officer yelled over the speaker. "In
              your dreams!" I said as I gave them the bird. I hit a hard right
              and scaled the wall. I was on the roof now. The two Wraiths were
              now on either side of me. I knew I could get away. Just a little
              more running. "Ha! Try to keep up! How many times have I gotten
              awa-" I smacked my face into something I didn't see.I got up from
              the ground and saw an all white Wraith standing over me. I
              couldn't smell the Eco Batts off of him. How? "Ma'am, I got him,"
              he said over his earpiece. He shot me with a shock round from his
              gun. It hurt badly but it was nothing that I wasn't already used
              to. He picked me up and cuffed me. A fancy police cruiser flew to
              the building that we were on and a familiar face stepped out.
              "Hey, Trish. How's about a second date?" I asked playfully. "Maybe
              in the interrogation room," she responded. "I want him in the car
              now. Tell the Wraiths on the ground to follow and get those
              snipers. Tell them to get in the car with us," She commanded. "The
              Yakuza got you by the neck too?" I asked. She gave no answer. "So
              who's the big guy?" "His name is I.C.E. An Invisble Clean
              Ecounit." "That's why I couldn't smell him. When did the police
              stop polluting the air?" "Since we caught you." "Caught who?" I
              said with my hands up and out of the cuffs. "What the-" "Bye-bye!"
              I said as I jumped off the roof. I ran and hid in the shadows. I
              reached a manhole cover and jumed in the sewers. I knew what my
              next plan would be. <a style="color: magenta;" href="semantic.html">Next Page</a>
