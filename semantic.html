            ><span style="color: hotpink; font-size: larger">As</span> I treaded
            through the sewers, I only had one thing on my mind: revenge. I had
            to find Crunch and teach him a lesson. Selling me out to the feds,
            he think he can just get away with that. He's got another thing
            coming. The Yakuza got everyone by the neck these days. And they all
            seem to be after me, unless I just attract trouble. I doubt that's
            the case though. Ever since they tried to screw me over and failed,
            they've been after me. I exited the sewers. Surprisingly, I was
            close to downtown. Crunch had a few safehouses, but always kept his
            stash in one. The one he kept it in was south of downtown, not too
            far from where I was. I made my way to his apartment. I could hear
            him talking through the door. "Y-You lost him?" Crunch said
            shakingly over the phone. "He's slippery. Not an easy target." The
            voice sounded familiar. It was Trish. "You know h-he'll be a-after
            me!" he screamed. "We already paid you, Scrooge. You have nothing to
            worry about," Trish told him. "What about p-protection!? He knows
            where I live! I will d-die!" The phone hung up. I kicked the door
            in. "So, how much did they pay you!?" I grabbed him. "S-See, this is
            all just a m-misunderstanding." "I don't care. Where's the money
            they gave you? That'll substitute for the payment you owe." "You
            can't take m-my money!" "I can." I punched him in his face, broke is
            other arm, and kicked him in his stomach. He was knocked out as I
            searched his house for the money. He always keeps a stash in his
            couch. I found it. JEEZ! 20 G's!!?? Guess I'm a high priced target.
            I left the apartment complex and headed further south. Next stop:
            The Southern District.

            >The Southern District is no fun place. Here you'll find the
            toughest thugs and best of hitmen. This is where I got into the
            game. Here is also how I got into the Yakuza. There's an office
            space above Remi's Deli. I climbed up the stairs that were hidden at
            the back of the store. I went up and was met with two guards.
            "Where's Ray? We got a problem with one of our clients," I told the
            guards. "He's in his office," the guard on the left said. "Thanks."
            I passed the dance floor, went behind the bar, and entered a door
            that led to Ray's office. "Ha, Loki! Good to see you, comrade!" he
            greeted me. "You too, but we got something serious on our plate," I
            told him. He gestured for me to sit, so I sat down in the chair in
            front of him. "The Yakuza is closing in on us. Crunch was working
            with the police and sold me out. The police is working with the
            Yakuza now. And now they have I.C.E. Wraiths that I can't smell.
            It's looking tough." "How do you know the police is working with
            Yakuza?" He asked. "Trish. Since we were kids, she could never lie
            to me. I could see it in her eyes. Plus they're working with
            criminals who are part of the Yakuza. Everything is adding up."
            "This is problem." He sat there, thinking. "You said I.C.E., right?
            New shipment came in this morning." He reached under his desk and
            pulled out a big box. "What's this?"" I asked. "Open it," he said. I
            opened the box. I was shocked. It looked like one of the I.C.E.
            Wraiths' suits. "Scrooge should no longer be problem." "They just
            started using these from what I heard." "This is the Black Market,
            comrade. We will have things before anyone, even the police." "Glad
            I'm on the right team." "Yes. My men had modified the suit. No need
            for bulky suit, just goggles. I had them fit for you," he informed
            me. "All of this for me? You shouldn't have." "You are good friend
            and I want to see Yakuza fall." I took the box and set it on the
            ground next to me. "So, what's next?" I asked. "What's next? Money,
            my friend."

              "Money?" I asked. "Yes, money. I will give money for your
              troubles, but I also have more jobs for you. Before we take Yakuza
              down, I need loose ends tightened," Ray explained. "I'm on it." "I
              will page details." "Sure thing." I walked out of the office with
              the suitcase in my hand. I headed back downtown to see Yuki. He
              wasn't at the shop counter, so I rung the bell. "Old man, you
              here?" I called out. There was a moment of silence before he
              appeared with his glasses on. "Oh, Loki, it's you. Why are you
              here?" he asked me. "I might not be around for a couple of days,
              maybe even weeks. You gonna be okay by yourself?" "I've always
              been okay. You don't have to worry about me. Go, I know it's
              related to business. Just come back safely, okay?" "Will do, old
              man." I waved good-bye and headed to a nearby alley. Luckily
              nobody was around. "Okay, let's see what this thing can do." I put
              on the goggles and saw a "system boot" on the hud. Ray wasn't
              kidding. These things fit perfectly. The boot was done and I was
              welcomed with a wave of infared. Maybe this thing can auto-detect
              when it's night. After playing around with the user interface for
              a while, I figured how to turn invisible. It's a lot different
              from what I expected. I could still see myself, but there's an
              image in the top right that gives me a live feed of the outside in
              which I was invisible. I understand now. I got a page from Ray.
              Three hits. Two East, one West. Shouldn't be difficult. I took the
              opportunity to take the goggles for a test drive. I started West,
              it'll be much easier as there would be less cops. So then I began.
              I left. I went from hit to hit, grabbing their stash and beating
              them to a pulp. The last one tried to fight back. He was no match,
              especially with this new Wraith tech I got. Soon I was back at the
              Black Market in Ray's office.

              >"You finished job?" He asked? "Yeah." I dropped three bags on the
              table. "You always make quick work." "Just doing my job. Now,
              Yakuza." "Rigt, Yakuza. I need you to sneak in dojo, and find
              safe. It has location of all outlets." "How do you know all of
              this?" "I have mole in Yakuza. Feeds me information, tasty
              information." "Right... Anyways, sneak in, crack safe, grab map,
              and dip." "Yes. After that, we will close each outpost, head
              north, and fight." "What about casualties?" I asked. "Yakuza fight
              with honor. However, we do not. Their loss. Any of men die, they
              are weak." "Then we have no time to waste." I ran out of the
              building and headed to the dojo. I used to train there when I was
              part of the Yakuza. That's where me and Trish went on our first
              date. Things went well between us. Everything seemed so fine and
              dandy. But we didn't agree on one thing. She wanted to be part of
              the police, she awed in the presence of justice. I, on the other
              hand, had my fun running through the streets and away from cops.
              In the end some things need to stay in the past, but we still have
              a thing for each other. I reached the dojo. There were four men in
              the front and four on the rear. I shouldn't have a problem with
              anyone due to the Wraith tech. Now all I have to do is enter. Time to take the Yakuza down!
